# Progressively Grown Deep Image Prior

This repository contains the code used for the experiments in my master's thesis. This implementation is based on the original [deep-image-prior](http://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/deep-image-prior) implementation, using concept from [Progressive Growing of GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) and custom pytorch layers from [pggan-pytorch](https://github.com/nashory/pggan-pytorch/).
